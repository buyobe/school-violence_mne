      <h3>Why This Matters for the NGO</h3>
      <p>
        These findings highlight priority areas for intervention. High-case regions and districts should be targeted for awareness campaigns, 
        while schools with persistent reports may need direct support such as teacher training, counseling services, or stronger reporting mechanisms.

  <!-- Policy Impact -->
  <div class="row mt-4">
    <div class="col-md-12">
      <h3>Policy Impact</h3>
      <p>
        The data collected aligns with national frameworks such as the <strong>Law of the Child Act (2009)</strong>, 
        the <strong>National Plan of Action to End Violence Against Women and Children (2017–2022)</strong>, 
        and Tanzania’s commitments under the <strong>Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 16.2)</strong> to end abuse, exploitation, trafficking, and all forms of violence against children.
      </p>
      <p>
        By identifying regions and schools with the highest cases, NGOs can provide evidence to government stakeholders and advocate for stronger enforcement of these policies, 
        improved child protection services, and increased funding for prevention programs.

        For deeper insights, the <strong>Visualization app</strong> can provide interactive charts showing trends over time, 
        comparisons across regions, and breakdowns by gender or age group. The <strong>Report app</strong> can generate 
        tailored reports for stakeholders, combining these insights with NGO recommendations and policy references.
